Pro Tips for mastering drifting:
The hold duration of the handbrake plays an important role in drifting. Turn while simultaneously holding the handbrake will drift your vehicle. Release the handbrake if your vehicle slows down. Before going into another turn, tap the handbrake once so that the vehicle does not spin off.

We believe that drifting should be as easy as possible so that non-expert drifters can enjoy drifting without having to understand the mechanics of it all. Hence the vehicle counter steers on its own so you don't find it difficult to control. There is an option to change this however, Drift Controller > Drift Type : Manual_NoAssists
